## Composite Design Pattern-


Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

The composite design pattern is used when we need to treat a group of objects in a similar way as a single object. This pattern allows us to have a tree structure and each object is going to perform a similar task

## Advantages

Defines class hierarchies
Easier to add new kind of components in the structure
The flexibility of structure with manageable interface

## Example

In Employee Management Application if we want to display employees as per hierarchy we can use a composite pattern for it where each object 
has similar responsibility of display details and for adding hierarchy we can use composite pattern.
